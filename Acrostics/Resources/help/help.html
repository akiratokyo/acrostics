        <h1>What is an Acrostic?</h1>
        <p>
        An acrostic puzzle is a hybrid between a cryptogram and a crossword puzzle.
        Your goal is to reveal a hidden quote in the grid at the top by correctly answering
        the crossword-style clues near the bottom of the puzzle.
        However, you can solve the quote and the clues simultaneously.
        Each letter in the quote is linked to a letter in one of the clue answers,
        so you can answer the clues or add to the quote.
        </p><p>
        As you answer more clues, more letters will begin to fill the quote grid.
        As you fill in the quote, parts of the clue answers are filled in.
        Eventually the entire quote is revealed.
        </p><p>
        What's more, the author and/or source of the quote will be spelled out by
        the first letter of each clue answer.
        This can also be used to help solve the puzzle.
        </p>
        <h1>Strategies</h1>
        <p>
        Acrostics are solved primarily by going back and forth between the different areas of the puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
        Clues are in the section right above the keyboard.
        Figuring out what word or phrase a clue is referring to
        will give you letters in both the quote and keywords.
        </p><p>
        Finishing a word that is almost complete in the quote will give you
        letters in clue solutions making it easier for you to figure out the answer to that clue.
        </p><p>
        When you have all the letters correct, the puzzle is complete!
        </p>
